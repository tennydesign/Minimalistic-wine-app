# prj3-Wine-Store-App
This third App is a minimalistic wine store with some clever hacking in it. This project is huuuuge. And, of course, I didn' had enough hours to clean it up. So, wysiwyg. 
This project features: 

- GCD async queues.
- Core Data. 
- CoreMotion (card shadow moves with gyroscope).
- Some very cool collectionView stretching (including the tinder-like, swipe right and left, add/remove to cart feature) 
- Very MVC (for the good and the bad).
- A extremely responsive cell, with a clever auto-layout hack, plays the entire catalog. 
- Only two cocoapods (slider up menu and star ratings) 
- Some serious real-time database with Firebase. 
- A more dense OOP structure. 
- Fully integrated with Apple Pay and PassKit. 
- Notifications (APN).
- JSON serialization using Decodable objects/ parsing.
- Two storyboards. 
- A very minimalistic customer facing storyboard (one main collectionViewController)
- Authentication (google sign in, and email sign in)
- Access to five different APIs. (involved in the wine label image recognition workflow)
- Protocols, Singletons (oh, I love singletons) and Delegates (many involved in controling the animations).  
- Very intricate animations. 
- Custom designed navigation controls, from scratch, not cocoapods. (top bar is actually an enhanced collection view etc...). 

- Apple's Material Design and Human Interface Guidelines. 
- Balsamiq prototype.
- POP (Marvel) prototype. 

** This App ranked #3 out of 15 in the the class (General Assembly iOS immersive SF). Check: #1 Sheeja and #2 [Jun's](Https://www.Github.com/juntomlee). 
 
 Total hacking time: ~180 hours.
